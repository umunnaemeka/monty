# Monty
monty is an interpreter of Monty ByteCodes files, which is a scripting language just like Python.

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at ALX Software Programme. It aims to learn about a language that contains specific instructions to manipulate data information (stacks or queues), where each instruction (called opcode) is sended per line. Files which contains Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `push` | Pushes an element to the stack |
| `pall` | Prints all the values on the stack |
| `pint` | Prints the value at the top of the stack |
| `pop` | Removes the top element of the stack |
| `swap` | Swaps the top two elements of the stack |
| `queue` | Sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO) |
| `stack` | Sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO) |
| `nop` | Doesn't do anything |
| `add` | Adds the top two elements of the stack |
| `sub` | Subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack |
| `mul` | Multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack |
| `div` | Divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack |
| `mod` | Computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack |
| `pchar` | Prints the char at the top of the stack |
| `pstr` | Prints the string starting at the top of the stack |
| `rotl` | Rotates the stack to the top |
| `rotr` | Rotates the stack to the bottom |
